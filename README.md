## Upgraded Lite Devices

If you have a Mysa Lite thermostat (BB-V2-0-L) that has been "magic upgraded" to full functionality using the debug tool's Lite-to-Full conversion, you need to configure it in Home Assistant:

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Mysa → Configure**
2. Select the upgraded device(s) in "Upgraded Lite Devices"
3. Click Submit

This ensures commands are sent with the correct protocol type (Type 5) for your hardware.

> **Note**: The debug tool's `advanced` menu includes the Lite-to-Full conversion feature. See [docs/MYSA_DEBUG.md](docs/MYSA_DEBUG.md) for details on this experimental operation.

## Debug Tool

A command-line debug tool is included for development and troubleshooting:

```bash
cd tools
python mysa_debug.py
```

Features include MQTT sniffing, HTTP/MQTT command testing, and advanced operations like Lite-to-Full conversion and device pairing mode reset.

See [docs/MYSA_DEBUG.md](docs/MYSA_DEBUG.md) for usage details.

## Protocol Documentation

For developers interested in the Mysa API, see [docs/MYSA_PROTOCOL.md](docs/MYSA_PROTOCOL.md).

## Requirements
